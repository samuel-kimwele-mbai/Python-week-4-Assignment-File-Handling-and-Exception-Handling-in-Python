# 📁 Python Week 4 Assignment: File Handling and Exception Handling

## 🧠 Description

This Python script demonstrates how to work with files and handle exceptions gracefully. It is divided into two parts:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge** 🖋️  
   - Reads content from an existing file (`initial.txt`)
   - Converts the content to uppercase
   - Writes the modified content to a new file (`modified.txt`)

2. **Error Handling Lab** 🧪  
   - Handles common file-related errors such as:
     - File not found (`FileNotFoundError`)
     - Input/Output errors (`IOError`)
